This is sample of mixed precision arithmetic from C#. 

GPU support mixed precision starting from computing capability 5.3, which means Volta, Pascal, and Jetson TX1

Before that (Maxwell, Kepler, Fermi...), the generated code won't compile but wait, Pascal is now so old that it has beed removed from latest drivers...
